==========

Bayesian extrapolation of LBRY tips. This is work in progress.

Dependency: DNest4. I'll make it more user friendly in time.

Todo list:

    * Implement something. Anything!
    * Use exported transactions file from LBRY app as data source
    * Complexify model (variable poisson rate etc, borrow strength across claims/publishers)
    * Get data from lbrynet directly instead of the app
