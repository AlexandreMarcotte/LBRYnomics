Let $\lambda(t)$ be the rate function. In the current implementation
it is constant, $\lambda(t) = \lambda$,
but it won't always be.

\section{Handling of discrete time}
Time is block height, where one unit equals 2.5 minutes.
The probability of $x_t$ tips in block $t$ is
\begin{align}
p(x_t \,|\, \lambda_t) &= \frac{\lambda_t^{x_t}\exp(-\lambda_t)}{x_t!}
\end{align}

Currently the data starts from the first claim and ends at the current
block height. Any tips before the first claim are considered spurious and
discarded.

Discrete time is currently handled by adding a random offset to the
block times, but that's what I want to fix.
