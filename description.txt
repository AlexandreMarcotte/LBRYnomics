I used TipPredict (https://github.com/eggplantbren/TipPredict) to forecast LBC tips received over the next month for some publishers on LBRY. This is a CSV file containing a low, a medium, and a high prediction for each of the creators on the list. The assumptions I used were quite basic "status quo" type assumptions, which assume that the next month is quite likely to look similar to previous months. If people find this service useful, I can make the assumptions much more realistic and sophisticated, including things like trends, and spikes when you publish.

So far the list of channels I've analysed is quite short (but it's longer than what you see in the thumbnail). If you'd like to be added to the list or removed from it the next time I update this file, contact me on Keybase or the LBRY Discord.

Formally, conditional on my assumptions, the probability of the next month's tips being between the low and high forecast is 90%, and it's 50/50 whether it's above or below the medium forecast. Some creators have more uncertain forecasts than others. This is due to two main effects: (i) a shorter tip history, so there's less data to extrapolate from, and/or (ii) greater variation in past tips received, which propagates through to greater uncertainty in the value of future tips received.
